#
# 1) CL request comes at 100ms in the slot (max timeout 1050ms in the slot), then:

#   - send request at 500ms with 550ms timeout
#   - send request at 800ms with 250ms timeout
# 2) CL request comes at 1500ms in the slot (max timeout 2000ms in the slot), then:
#   - send request at 1500ms with 500ms timeout
#   - send request at 1800ms with 200ms timeout
# 3) CL request comes 2500ms in the slot then:
#   - return 204 and force local build
