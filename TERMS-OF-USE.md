A demand for arbitration shall be made within a reasonable time after the claim, dispute, or other matter has arisen, and in no event shall such demand be made after the date when institution of legal or equitable proceedings based on such claim, dispute, or other matter in question would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations. The decision of arbitrators shall be rendered within sixty (60) days of submission of any claim or dispute, shall be in writing and mailed to all the parties included in the arbitration. The decision of the arbitrator shall be binding upon the parties and judgment in accordance with that decision may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
