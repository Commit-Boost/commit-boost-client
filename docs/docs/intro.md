# Introduction

![Commit Boost Logo](/img/logo.jpg)

Due to the risks developing for Ethereum, core development, and its validators set, a group of teams / individuals are working on developing a public good called Commit-Boost. Commit-Boost is an open-source public good that is fully compatible with [MEV-Boost](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost), but acts as a light-weight validator platform to safely make commitments. Specifically, Commit-Boost is a new Ethereum validator sidecar focused on standardizing the last mile of communication between validators and third-party protocols. It's being developed in Rust from scratch, and has been designed with safety and modularity at its core, with the goal of not limiting the market downstream including stakeholders, flows, proposer commitments, enforcement mechanisms, etc.
