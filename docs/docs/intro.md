# Introduction

![Commit Boost Logo](/img/logo.jpg)

Commit-Boost is a new Ethereum validator sidecar focused on standardizing the last mile of communication between validators and third-party protocols. It is fully compatible with [MEV-Boost](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost) and can also act as a validator platform to enable optional safe commitments. It's being developed in Rust from scratch, with the goal of widening the range of different proposer commitments protocols, and open the design space around them.
