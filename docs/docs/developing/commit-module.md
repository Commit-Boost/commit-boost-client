# Commit Module

While a module can be written in any language, we currently provide some utils for Rust, with the goal of supporting more generalized APIs and simplify development in languages other than Rust.

:::note
Commit-Boost is still in alpha development, all APIs are subject to change
:::


In Rust, we provide utilities to load and run modules. Simply add to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
commit-boost = { git = "https://github.com/Commit-Boost/commit-boost-client", rev = "..." }
```

You will now be able to import the utils with:
```rust
use commit_boost::prelude::*;
```


## Config
Your module will likely need a configuration for the Node Operator to customize. This will have to be in the `cb-config.toml` file, in the correct `[[module]]` section. In the module, you can define and load your config as follows.

First define all the parameters needed in a struct:
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
struct ExtraConfig {
    sleep_secs: u64,
}
```
then pass that struct to the `load_commit_module_config` function, which will load and parse the config. Your custom config will be under the `extra` field.

```rust
let config = load_commit_module_config::<ExtraConfig>().unwrap();
let to_sleep = config.extra.sleep_secs;
```

The loaded `config` also has a few other useful fields:
- the unique `id` of the module
- chain spec
- a `SignerClient` to call the [SignerAPI](/api), already setup with the correct JWT


## Requesting signatures
At its core the Signer Module simply provides a signature on a 32-byte data digest. The signatures are currently provided with either the validator keys (BLS) or a proxy key (BLS or ECDSA) for a given validator key, both on the [builder domain](https://github.com/Commit-Boost/commit-boost-client/blob/main/crates/common/src/signature.rs#L88-L96).

In the example we use `TreeHash`, already used in the CL, to create the digest from a custom struct:
```rust
#[derive(TreeHash)]
struct Datagram {
    data: u64,
}
```

Furthermore, in order to request a signature, we'd need a public key of the validator. You can get a list of available keys by calling:
```rust
let pubkeys = config.signer_client.get_pubkeys().await.unwrap();
```

Which will call the `get_pubkeys` endpoint of the [SignerAPI](/api), returning all the consensus pubkeys and the corresponding proxy keys, of your module.

Then, we can request a signature either with a consensus key or with a proxy key:

### With a consensus key
Requesting a signature is as simple as:
```rust
let datagram = Datagram { data: 1 };
let request = SignConsensusRequest::builder(pubkey).with_msg(&datagram);
let signature = config.signer_client.request_consensus_signature(&request).await.unwrap();
```

Where `pubkey` is the validator (consensus) public key for which the signature is requested.

### With a proxy key
You'll have to first request a proxy key be generated for a given consensus key.
We support two signature schemes for proxies: BLS or ECDSA.

To request a proxy:
```rust
// BLS proxy
let proxy_delegation = self.config.signer_client.generate_proxy_key_bls(pubkey).await?;
let proxy_pubkey = proxy_delegation.message.proxy;

// or ECDSA proxy
let proxy_delegation = self.config.signer_client.generate_proxy_key_ecdsa(pubkey).await?;
let proxy_pubkey = proxy_delegation.message.proxy;
```

Where `pubkey` is the validator (consensus) public key for which a proxy is to be generated.

Then you can use the generated proxy key to request a signature:
```rust
let datagram = Datagram { data: 1 };
let request = SignProxyRequest::builder(proxy_pubkey).with_msg(&datagram);
// if `proxy_pubkey` is a BLS proxy
let signature = config.signer_client.request_proxy_signature_bls(&request).await.unwrap();
// or for ECDSA proxy
let signature = config.signer_client.request_proxy_signature_ecdsa(&request).await.unwrap();
```

## Metrics
We provide support for modules to record custom metrics which are automatically scraped by Prometheus. This involves three steps
### Define metrics
You can use the `prometheus` crate to create a custom registry and metrics, for example:

```rust
static ref MY_CUSTOM_REGISTRY: Registry = Registry::new_custom(Some("da_commit".to_string()), None).unwrap();
static ref SIG_RECEIVED_COUNTER: IntCounter = IntCounter::new("signature_received", "successful signatures requests received").unwrap();
```

### Start Metrics Provider
When starting the module, you should register all metrics, and start the `MetricsProvider`:
```rust
MY_CUSTOM_REGISTRY.register(Box::new(SIG_RECEIVED_COUNTER.clone())).unwrap();
MetricsProvider::load_and_run(MY_CUSTOM_REGISTRY.clone());
```
The `MetricsProvider` will load the configuration needed and start a server with a `/metrics` endpoint for Prometheus to scrape.

### Record metrics
All that is left is to use the metrics throughout your code:
```rust
SIG_RECEIVED_COUNTER.inc();
```
These will automatically scraped by the Prometheus service running, and exposed on port `9090`. We plan to allow developers to ship pre-made dashboards together with their modules, to allow Node Operators to have an improved oversight on the modules they are running.
