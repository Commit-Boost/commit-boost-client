# Background
- Proposer commitments have been an important part of Ethereum’s history and could continue to be a powerful unlock for Ethereum
- Today, we already see the power of commitments where nearly 90% of validators currently make a wholesale commitment that outsources block building to a sophisticated actor called a block builder (facilitated by a software called MEV-Boost)
- However, a wholesale commitment gives away the proposer’s autonomy over the block. Many are starting to realize that if proposers could make more granular commitments, there is a significant design space and opportunity for Ethereum and its validators
- On the surface, all the efforts around proposer commitments are a unlock for Ethereum, with most starting to agree on a common denominator: in the future, validators will face a broader set of options of what they may “commit" to
- While this all seems great, the challenge is that this already is and will continue to drive fragmentation and risks for Ethereum and proposers
- Commit-Boost is aimed to standardize proposer commitment protocols communication with the proposer with unification behind one sidecar helping to reduce the risk of fragmentation
